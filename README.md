# es_admin2
Hi! I'm not the creator of this script I just redesigned it and added some features.  

- I added the Spectate function, to make it work you will need: esx_spectate  
- I added the function of logs linked to discord, to put the webhook go to: es_admin2/server.lua line 22  
- I have forbidden that players with the "user" group can see the menu.  
- I redesigned it as best I could, any advice is welcome.     


--  The language used in the menu is Italian, obviously change it to yours.  
I hope you like what I did.
